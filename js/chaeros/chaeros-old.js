//========== CHÃ†EROS ==========
//When Flux actions are too heavy to be quasi-instantaneous, powerValve sends a message to the main process. This
//message is both the function to be executed, and an object containing its arguments. Once recieved, the main process
//creates a new invisible (never shown) window which calls the chaeros module, and executes one of the functions below,
//depending on what has been called by powerValve and transmitted by the main process. While executing, the chaeros
//module sends messages to the main process informing of the state of the function's execution, which is in turn
//redispatched to the index's "coreCanvas" and "field" (the main field), which subsequently impacts the core animation
//and the field's value.
