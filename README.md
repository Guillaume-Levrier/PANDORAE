# PANDORÆ

For more information on PANDORÆ, go to the [project page](https://guillaume-levrier.github.io/PANDORAE/), check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Guillaume-Levrier/PANDORAE/wiki) and the [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/PANDORAE_CORE)   account.

Download **PANDORÆ version 1.0.01** for [Windows](https://anthropos-ecosystems.com/pandorae/PANDORAE-win32-x64.zip), [macOS](https://anthropos-ecosystems.com/pandorae/PANDORAE-darwin-x64.zip) or [Linux](https://anthropos-ecosystems.com/pandorae/PANDORAE-linux-x64.zip) (±100 Mo).

Please put your extracted PANDORÆ folder/app where you usually put apps on your computer (i.e. Program Files on Windows, Applications on macOS). It might work if you don't, but this will solve starting issues.

*This version is incomplete. Some processes are untested, others are unstable. But due to the security alerts sent by Electron, this seems to be the safe thing to do.*

*If you want to use PANDORÆ for an academic purpose in the very short term, get in touch and I'll check the validity of the process you're using.*
