# PANDORÃ† Roadmap

To test the dev branch, clone the repo, cd into it, and use 'npm i', './node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild' then 'npm start'.

License issues : some package/code license issues might still be around after the pre-upload cleanup. If you find one or more, please reach out on Twitter (@Li_Guilong) and I'll try to make it right.

### TODO
- comment each and every line of JS
- create an interactive scroller/flowchart tutorial

##### Flux
- design a specific flux landing page

##### Next version
- implement FETCH altmetric requests
