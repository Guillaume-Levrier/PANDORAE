# PANDORÃ† Roadmap

Download Alpha-90 version :
- [macOS](https://anthropos-ecosystems.com/pandorae/PANDORAE-macOS.zip)

If you'd rather test the dev branch, clone the repo, cd into it, and use 'npm i', './node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild' then 'npm start'.

**License issues :** some package/code license issues might still be around after the pre-upload cleanup. If you find one or more, please reach out on Twitter (@Li_Guilong) and I'll try to make it right.

### TODO
- comment each and every line of JS (under way)
- create an interactive scroller/flowchart tutorial (under way)
- enable gazouillotype brush (next version)
- multithread visualisations (under way)
- solve errors in affiliation coordinates (check city then country before choosing, instead of taking the first guess)

##### Flux
- revamp the whole flux thing

##### Next version
- implement FETCH altmetric requests
